<h1>The Lambda Papers</h1>

	<p>Papers by Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman published as AI Memos
		by the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory between
		December 1975 and March 1979.</p>
	<p>As noted in <a href="https://standards.scheme.org/early/">Early standards</a>, 
		the tone of these papers is relatively informal and their typesetting targetted 1970s
		computer printing technology. 
    Scans of original printed copies are available in the digital repository of 
    <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/discover?scope=%2F&query=Lambda&submit=Go&filtertype_0=author&filtertype_1=author&filter_relational_operator_1=notcontains&filter_relational_operator_0=contains&filter_1=Rich&filter_0=Steele%2C+Guy&rpp=10&sort_by=dc.date.issued_dt&order=asc"
    >MIT research</a>
    and are listed in the Computer History Museum Software Preservation Group's
    <a href="https://softwarepreservation.computerhistory.org/LISP/scheme_family.html#Scheme_"
    >Scheme Project</a></p>
	<p>HTML transcriptions with internal navigation and bibliography links are available here.
		The formatting of these transcriptions aims to retain the character of the originals,
		with updated typography and navigation;
	  the HTML versions are self-contained files which can be saved and viewed offline.</p>

	<a href="lambda-papers-scheme-report.html"><strong>SCHEME: An Interpreter For Extended Lambda Calculus</strong></a>.
  AIM-349, December 1975. 
  (<a href="#note1">Note 1</a>)
	<blockquote>
		"Inspired by ACTORS, we have implemented an interpreter for a LISP-like language, 
	  SCHEME, based on the lambda calculus, but extended for side effects, multiprocessing, and 
	  process synchronization..." 
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Steele, Guy L and Sussman, Gerald Jay. 
	<a href="lambda-papers-ltu-imperative.html"><strong>LAMBDA: The Ultimate Imperative</strong></a>.<br/>
  AIM-353, March 1976.
	<blockquote>
		"We demonstrate how to model the following common programming constructs in terms of an 
		applicative order language similar to LISP: - Simple Recursion - Iteration - Compound 
		Statements and Expressions - GO TO and Assignment - Continuation-Passing - Escape 
		Expressions - Fluid Variables - Call by Name, Call by Need, and Call by Reference..."
  </blockquote></p>
		
<p>Steele, Guy L. 
  <a href="lambda-papers-ltu-declarative.html"><strong>LAMBDA The Ultimate Declarative</strong></a>.<br/>
  AIM-379, November 1976. 
	<blockquote>
		"In this paper, a sequel to LAMBDA: The Ultimate Imperative, a new view of LAMBDA as a 
		renaming operator is presented and contrasted with the usual functional view taken by 
		LISP..."
  </blockquote></p>

  <a href="lambda-papers-compiler-optimization.html"><strong>Compiler Optimization Based on Viewing LAMBDA as RENAME plus GOTO</strong></a>.<br/>
  May 1977.
  (<a href="#note2">Note 2</a>)
	<blockquote>
    "We have developed a compiler for the lexically-scoped dialect of LISP known as SCHEME. 
		The compiler knows relatively little about specific data manipulation primitives such as
	  arithmetic operators, but concentrates on general issues of environment and control..."
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Steele, Guy L. 
  <strong><a href="lambda-papers-ltu-goto.html">Debunking the "Expensive Procedure Call" Myth or, Procedure Call 
	Implementations Considered Harmful or, LAMBDA: The Ultimate GOTO</a></strong>. <br/>
  AIM-443, October 1977. 
	<blockquote>
    "Folklore states that GOTO statements are "cheap", while procedure calls are "expensive". 
		This myth is largely a result of poorly designed language implementations..."	
  </blockquote></p>
	
<p>Steele, Guy L and Sussman, Gerald Jay. 
	<strong><a href="lambda-papers-revised-report.html">The Revised Report on SCHEME A Dialect of LISP</a></strong>.<br/>
  AIM-452, January 1978.
	<blockquote>
	  "SCHEME is a dialect of LISP. It is an expression-oriented, applicative order, 
		interpreter-based language which allows one to manipulate programs as data..."
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Sussman, Gerald Jay and Steele, Guy L. 
  <a href="lambda-papers-interpreter.html"><strong>The Art of the Interpreter or, The 
	Modularity Complex (Parts Zero, One, and Two)</strong></a>.<br/>
  AIM-453, May 1978. 
	<blockquote>
    "We examine the effects of various language design decisions on the programming styles 
		available to a user of the language, with particular emphasis on the ability to 
		incrementally construct modular systems. At each step we exhibit an interactive 
		meta-circular interpreter for the language under consideration..."

  <a href="lambda-papers-rabbit.html"><strong>RABBIT: A compiler for SCHEME
  (A Dialect of LISP) A Study in Compiler Optimization Based on Viewing LAMBDA as RENAME 
  and PROCEDURE CALL as GOTO</strong></a>.<br/>
  AITR-474, May 1978. 
	<blockquote>
    "We have developed a compiler for the lexically-scoped dialect of LISP known as SCHEME. 
		The compiler knows relatively little about specific data manipulation primitives such as 
		arithmetic operators, but concentrates on general issues of environment and control..."
  </blockquote></p>
		
<p>Steele, Guy L and Sussman, Gerald Jay. 
  <a href="lambda-papers-ltu-opcode.html"><strong>Design of LISP-based Processors, 
	or SCHEME: A Dielectric LISP, or Finite Memories Considered Harmful, or LAMBDA: The 
	Ultimate Opcode</strong></a>.<br/>
  AIM-514, March 1979. 
	<blockquote>
    "We present a design for a class of computers whose 'instruction sets' are based on LISP. 
		LISP, like traditional stored-program machine languages and unlike most high-level 
		languages, conceptually stores programs and data in the same way and explicitly allows 
		programs to be manipulated as data. LISP is therefore a suitable language around which 
		to design a stored-program computer architecture..."
