  <h2>Early standards</h2>
  <p>The first three reports on Scheme were published as research
  memos by the <b>MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</b> (now
  <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>), the birthplace
  of both Lisp and Scheme.</p>
  <p>These early reports are written in an informal tone with
  improvised typesetting. The language definition is not as
  rigorous or comprehensive as in the later reports. The language
  is still seeking its form. These versions of Scheme are
  incompatible with modern Scheme and with each other. No release
  of any Scheme implementation since about 1990 is based on
  them.</p>
  <div class="round-box blue-box">
    <h3>Retroactive naming convention</h3>
    <p>Modern Scheme reports are named <b>Revised<sup>n</sup>
    Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme</b>, abbreviated
    <b>R<sup>n</sup>RS</b>. The first standard explicitly named
    thus was <a href="../#r3rs">R<sup>3</sup>RS</a>. The names of
    the earlier reports have been retroactively abbreviated using
    the same pattern: R<sup>2</sup>RS and R<sup>1</sup>RS. As a
    <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation#Zero_exponent">mathematical
    pun</a>, the initial report is dubbed R<sup>0</sup>RS since it
    isn't revised at all.</p>

    <p>The abstract of the paper was written as a poem:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Data and procedures and the values they amass,<br>
      Higher-order functions to combine and mix and match,<br>
      Objects with their local state, the messages they pass,<br>
      A property, a package, the control point for a catch —<br>
      In the Lambda Order they are all first-class.<br>
      One Thing to name them all, One Thing to define them,<br>
      One Thing to place them in environments and bind them,<br>
      In the Lambda Order they are all first-class.</i>
